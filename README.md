NTRODUCTION
This project is to develop a Virtual Mouse and Keyboard using Hand Gesture   Recognition.
Instead of using more expensive sensors , a simple web camera can identify the hand gesture & perform the action. 
It helps the user to interact with a computer without any physical & hardware device to control mouse and keyboard operations. 

PROBLEM STATEMENT 
To design a virtual mouse and keyboard which detects hand gestures and performs  operations only using the fingers . 
We used different combinations of fingers to perform various operations of the mouse and keyboard according to which particular combination of fingers is recognized . 
Traditional computer interaction methods such as physical mouse and keyboard may not be suitable for individuals with certain physical disabilities or conditions that affect their motor skills, such as Parkinson's disease, cerebral palsy, or amputations.


EXISTING SYSTEM
Existing System
Physical Keyboard / Wireless Keyboard
Physical Mouse / Wireless Mouse
Track pad / Touch pad 

Limitation
If you can’t touch or type it can be time consuming to enter the data .
Slower and susceptible to interference . 
If device is damaged the operation is not performed

AIM OF THE PROJECT
The main goal of proposed AI virtual mouse and keyboard  system is to develop an alternative to the regular and traditional mouse and keyboard system to perform and control the mouse and keyboard functions.
Additionally, the use of hand gestures for computer interaction can provide a more natural and intuitive user interface, leading to increased efficiency and accuracy in performing tasks such as scrolling, clicking, and typing.
This can be especially beneficial for users who spend extended periods of time using computers, such as office workers, gamers, or students.

OBJECTIVES
nable hands-free computer interaction: The virtual mouse and keyboard would allow users to       control their computer without using a physical mouse or keyboard, making it easier for people with physical disabilities or mobility impairments to use computers.
Improve user experience: The use of hand gestures to interact with a computer could provide a more natural and intuitive user interface, leading to improved user experience and productivity.

APPLICATION
Industrial settings: The virtual mouse and keyboard can be used in industrial settings, such as manufacturing plants or 
     warehouses, where workers need to wear gloves or other protective gear that make it difficult to use traditional input devices.

Gaming: The use of hand gestures for controlling games is a popular application of this technology.

Education: The technology can be used in classrooms or educational settings where multiple students share a 
     single computer. The use of hand gestures can help reduce the spread of germs and bacteria and can also provide 
     an engaging and interactive learning experience for students.

Medical Sector: 
Healthcare: The virtual mouse and keyboard can be used in healthcare settings, such as operating rooms or 
     hospitals, where the use of physical input devices like a mouse or keyboard can be difficult due to hygiene concerns.

CONCLUSION
The main objective of the virtual mouse system is to control the mouse cursor functions by using the hand 
     gestures instead of using a physical mouse and the virtual keyboard is controlled by tracking coloured object.

The proposed system can be achieved by using a webcam or a built-in camera which detects the hand gestures 
     processes frames to perform the particular mouse functions and detect coloured object and perform keyboard 
     function accordingly ,then display to text file.

From the results of the model, can come to a conclusion at the proposed virtual mouse and keyboard system 
     has performed very well and has a greater accuracy compared to the existing models and also the model 
     overcomes most of the limitations of existing systems.

Since the proposed model has greater accuracy, the virtual mouse and keyboard can be used for real-world 
     applications, and also, it can be used to reduce the spread of COVID-19, since the proposed mouse system can 
     be used virtually using hand gestures and object without using the traditional device.
